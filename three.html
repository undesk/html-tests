                    <p>With the possible exception of the people who think Barack Obama is a robot controlled by Hitler, Apple fans are probably the most loyal, vocal and organised pressure group on the planet.
Slag off Apple and they'll fact-check you to death - but while some Apple criticisms are lazy, the firm they're defending is often less than perfect.
From weird products to disturbing corporate behaviour, here are 26 things that give us the Sad Mac icon.</p>
                    <p>If any other company said to its customers - after it had taken their money - "Yeah, we know it's crap, but it's just a hobby" we'd be at their front door with flaming torches.</p>
                    <p>We don't even live in America, and Apple's devilish deal with AT&T still annoys us. Our friends on the other side of the Atlantic still can't take advantage of iPhone tethering because AT&T can't cope with the potential increase in traffic. Madness.</p>
                    <p>You can't download a Google Voice app because Apple's in a huff with Google. You can't use Skype on 3G yet because certain networks didn't like the idea. Apps that do a better job than the iPhone's woeful Wi-Fi detector get blocked because they apparently use super-secret API calls. You get the idea.</p>
